## GitHub Search
This app was created in order to provide a dynamic and quick asynchronous way of viewing GitHub user data. The only input need is a GitHub username. GitHub user data such as email, company, and bio are provided in the form of a semantic card. User feedback is also provided in the event that the user types in a name that is not a valid GitHub username either through invalid characters or if that username does not actually exist on GitHub.
